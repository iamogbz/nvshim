# NVM Shim

Automagically use the correct version of node with [`nvm exec`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage) functionality.

> **No more `nvm use`**

This will use existing [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) file, falling back to the [`nvm alias default`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage-1) version if no config detected.
